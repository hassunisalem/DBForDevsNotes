# DBForDevsNotes


The course focuses on five different database types:

### Relational databases

A relational database is a type of database that uses a structure 
that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database.

### Column based databases

A column-oriented DBMS or columnar DBMS is a database management system (DBMS) that stores data tables by column rather than by row.

### Document databases

A document-oriented database, or document store, is a computer program and data storage system designed for storing, 
retrieving and managing document-oriented information, also known as semi-structured data

### Graph databases

In computing, a graph database (GDB) is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data.
 A key concept of the system is the graph (or edge or relationship).

### Key-value stores

A key–value database, or key–value store, is a data storage paradigm designed for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays, and a data structure more commonly known today as a dictionary or hash table.
