# DBForDevsNotes


## The course focuses on five different database types:


### Relational databases

A relational database is a type of database that uses a structure 
that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database.


### Column based databases

A column-oriented DBMS or columnar DBMS is a database management system (DBMS) that stores data tables by column rather than by row.


### Document databases

A document-oriented database, or document store, is a computer program and data storage system designed for storing, 
retrieving and managing document-oriented information, also known as semi-structured data. Documents can contain nested structures,
and so they exhibit a high degree of flexibility, allowing for variable domains.
The system imposes few restrictions on incoming data, as long as it meets
the basic requirement of being expressible as a document.


### Graph databases

In computing, a graph database (GDB) is a database that uses graph structures for semantic queries with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data.
 A key concept of the system is the graph (or edge or relationship).


### Key-value stores

A key–value database, or key–value store, is a data storage paradigm designed for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays, and a data structure more commonly known today as a dictionary or hash table.

Redis - gains amazing performance in exchange for increased risk of data loss in the case of a
hardware failure. 



## Additional notes


### PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL (or just “Postgres”) is a relational database management system
(or RDBMS for short).Relational databases are set-theory-based systems in
which data is stored in two-dimensional tables consisting of data rows and
strictly enforced column types.
